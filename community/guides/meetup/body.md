# How To Hold A 1729 Meetup

The purpose of 1729 meetups is to build the network state, and right now that means two things:

1. Offering a way to learn, burn, and earn together
2. Providing a sandbox for working out what it looks like to bring network-native practices into meatspace.

Some examples of both types of activity should help make the point.

### Examples of learn/burn/earn:

*Learn:*
- Book/article/etc. of the week discussion
- A presentation on a piece of foundational knowledge or other core academic concept.

*Burn:*
- Group workouts, runs, or other exercises.
- Exchange some proof that you finished a workout (mutual verification of workout)
- Discussion of longevity, transhumanism, etc.

*Earn:*
- A presentation on a specific technology or project that's  related to web3
- A hackathon for new members where they do some tasks like setting up a wallet, minting an NFT, or similar.

### Example of sandboxing:

The main thing we want to sandbox initially is online pseudonymity. Specifically, we want to ask and answer the following kinds of questions around how we translate our different online personas into meatspace.

- What does it look like to participate in an in-person event under a pseudonym? Is it just about name-tags and modes of address, or is there more to it? Do you maybe wear the same color as your VR avatar? Do you have a T-shirt with your NFT avatar on it?

- What do the post-event digital representations of the event look like with pseudonymity left intact? Are people's faces replaced with their avatars? Or do most members not really care about this?

- What happens if you change pseudonyms in between meetups? During a meetup? Is this a thing we want to limit because people are doing too much of it, or is it something we don't care about because nobody is doing any of it?

Meetups will provide venues for working through the kinds of practical challenges that will arise when the network state turns into a geographic entity with actual land.

## Security and safety

1729ers who meet up outside, say, Austin Texas are in a permissive environment where they face no scrutiny from authorities or blowback for their participation in a meetup. Members in, say, Cuba may be meeting in a non-permissive environment (NPE). And members in a place like Hong Kong -- a geography that's currently in a transitional phase -- may find their environment growing less permissive as time passes.

So given that 1729 is widely distributed geographically, and different geographies will respond to what we're doing with different levels of permissiveness, we want to incorporate security considerations into the very start of our efforts, regardless of where we are.

On a practical level, this means we want to be intentional about developing a set of practices and defaults that will keep our members safe regardless of their environment. 

The security issue is also directly related to the aforementioned goal of maintaining online pseudonymity in offline contexts. The following list of recommended practices for meetups illustrates the ways these two go together:

- Use a private messaging app, like a Signal or Whatsapp chat, to organize locally.
- Respect pseudonymity and don't doxx. This means we default to addressing people by their Discord handle or other pseudonym unless they request otherwise.
- The current social media default way of attesting that we were all here in this place and did this thing, is to take a group selfie. In contrast, the 1729 default is to mint an NFT for the event. The selfie is optional and not assumed.
- The 1729 default photo policy at events is that nobody takes pictures that are tied to the event in any way. If pictures are permitted, the host announce the different policy well in advance.
- If pictures are allowed, be sure to have everyone's consent to be in the frame of any given photo. Assume by default that you don't have consent and you're not going to get it. Be surprised and grateful if it's granted. Should a person decline to be photographed, then that doesn't mean anything about them or you, so don't read anything into it. 

## Responsibilities

A meetup host is responsible for the following:

1. Make sure the venue is safe and accessible, and suitable for the kind of meetup you're hosting. I.e., if the meetup is a group jog, there should a safe path marked out beforehand; if it's a hackathon, you'll need power outlets. Ensuring that the venue is ready is on the host.
2. Set and announce a photos policy well in advance. The default for 1729 events is no photos at the event, and it's assumed unless a "photos allowed" policy is announced at the time the event is first announced.
3. See that pseudonyms are respected and that all policies governing the meeting are enforced.
4. Take attendance at the event.
5. Following the event, submit a form listing all the attendees so that everyone can get their POAP.

A meetup guest has the following responsibilities:

1. RSVP to the event in a timely manner, so the host can plan accordingly.
2. Come fully equipped and prepared to learn, earn, or burn.
3. Make sure your pseudonym is known and/or knowable. 
4. Confirm that your attendance is recorded by the host.
