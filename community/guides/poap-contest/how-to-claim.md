# How To Claim Your Prize In The POAP NFT Art Contest

We'd like all the contest entries to be available to the community to build on and remix, so we're asking each entrant to place their entries under the Creative Commons 1.0 Universal license.

The sections below outline the steps will allow you to publish your work as CC and claim your prize. We'll then update the work in this repo to reflect the fact that it's CC-licensed and free for the community to use and build on.

## 1. Fill out the license form and submit it

Go to [this link](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/) on the Creative Commons website and click "begin >>" after having read and understood the whole page.

Fill out the CC licensing form on the pattern of the image below, using the following as a guide:

- *Your name*: There isn't really a pseudonymous option, so you'll need to enter your real name here. DM us if this is a problem.

- *Your URL*: Enter the Github URL we sent you, which has copies of your entries along with some information.

- *Title of work*: 1729 POAP NFT Art Contest Entry

- *Territory*: The territory where your legal residence is and from where you're offering this work for the public's use. Again, this isn't pseudonymity-friendly, so DM us if this is a problem.

Finally, check the waiver box, review all the terms and be sure you fully understand (and consent) to them, and click "Continue". 

You'll then be asked to confirm the waiver, and once you do you'll be taken to a screen where you can enter your email:

Enter your own email, preferably the one you used when applying to the 1729.com beta program, and click "Send".

You'll then get an email like the following, which you'll forward to `jon@1729.com`.

## 2. Receive your prize

Once I get the email from you with the CC license to your work in it, I will update the Github URL with your entry to reflect the CC licensing. 

I should already have your ETH address on-file, so look for your prize at that address.
