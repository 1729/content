# Summary

Here's a
[minimum description
length](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/minimum-description-length-principle)-motivated
summary of the Network State. We'll do the one
sentence, one paragraph, and one page versions. For the ten page
version, read [chapter one](/the-network-state). And for the one
hundred-plus-page version, read [the whole thing](/).

## One sentence

A network state is a social network with a clear leader, an integrated
cryptocurrency, a definite purpose, a sense of national consciousness,
and a plan to crowdfund territory.

## One paragraph

Technology enables new companies, new communities, and new currencies. 

How do we use it to create new cities or new countries? 

The key: cloud first, land last. The steps:

   1.	Form a social network with a clear leader and dispute resolution mechanism. Legitimacy comes from people opting in.

   2.	Meet up in the physical world. Build an internal economy with cryptocurrency.

   3.	Crowdfund apartments, houses, and towns. Bring digital citizens into co-living communities in the physical world.

   4.	Network these pieces into a network state, a digital archipelago with territory distributed around the world.

As the network state grows, it will gradually attain diplomatic recognition from existing sovereigns, and ultimately the UN, just as Bitcoin became a bona-fide national currency.

## One page

Technology, cryptocurrency, and Asia are on the rise. America and the West are in decline.

There are many exceptions, including cities and states in the US, and parts of Europe. Yet, our future generally appears to be a centralized East and a decentralized West.

1. What should the decentralized West avoid?

   i. Anarcho-tyranny.

   Today, the anarchy of unpunished public stabbings combined with the tyranny of unlimited parking tickets is best exemplified by San Francisco. That model may        well be exported to much of the Anglosphere. Fundamentally, state capacity of modern America is too low to maintain this tyranny for long.

   ii. Crypto-anarchy.

   If and when BTC replaces the USD as global reserve currency, Bitcoin citadels may crop up in lawless regions, funded by the wealth of early holders. But there      are many societal goods you can't easily buy, like a walk down the street in a high-trust community. Mad Max isn't a desirable long-term outcome for anyone, even    Bitcoin Maximalists.

   iii. Control by a Chinese superstate.

   Nature abhors a vacuum. A durably stateless West would be a playground for foreign powers. The aggression principle always trumps the non-aggression principle.

2. What should the decentralized West look like?

   i. Crypto-civilization.

   We should build a new world where anyone can be a country founder or crypto-citizen. A new world where we can peacefully start new countries, join them, form        alliances between them, switch allegiances, and balance decentralized competition with centralized cooperation.

   ii. Enabled by the network state.

       a) a country you can start from your computer, 
       b) an archipelago of digitally-linked enclaves, 
       c) a territory you can peacefully acquire but not violently conquer, and
       d) a group organized by geodesic rather than geographic distance.

The rise of innovation in bits has not yet fully unlocked innovation in atoms â€” until now. 

That is the subject of [this book](/the-network-state).
