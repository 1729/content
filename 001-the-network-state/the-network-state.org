* The Network State
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t
:END:  
  
A proposition is not a nation, though it can become one. Here we
describe a peaceful, reproducible process for turning an online
community premised on a proposition into a physical state with a
virtual capital: a /network state/, the sequel to the nation state.

A network state is a social network with a recognized founder, an
integrated cryptocurrency, a definite purpose, a sense of national
consciousness, and a plan to crowdfund territory. The state formation
process begins with a /founding influencer/, who organizes the online
community that eventually buys land in the physical world. Crucially,
that land is not necessarily [[https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country][contiguous]]. In fact, by default, it's
distributed all over the world.

To understand what a network state looks like, and how it differs from
a traditional nation state, take a look at Figure
\ref{fig:the-network-state-dashboard}. As this dashboard shows, a
network state is composed of /network nodes/, each of which represents
a group of digital netizens who have chosen to live together in the
physical world.

[[./assets/network-state-dashboard-1729.png]]

The dashboard also demonstrates a key property of the network state:
quantified growth. The series of snapshots in Figures
\ref{fig:ns1}-\ref{fig:ns1m} shows how the network state formation
process can begin with a single founding influencer and scale to a
million person physical community. The Network State founder's task is
as simple (and as difficult) as recruiting a community online that is
capable of crowdfunding and coliving in land around the world.

Essentially, just like a tech company or a social network, the network
state provides a smooth path from a single person with a computer and
no other resources to a million person global network. The difference
is that a network state is more ambitious. It's meant to start on the
internet and become a peer to sovereign countries, just like Bitcoin
started on the internet and became a peer to sovereign currencies.

Something of that scale has many facets. We can variously think of the
network state as an archipelago of interconnected enclaves, a country
you can start from your computer, a group defined by geodesic over
geographic distance, a city-state in the cloud, a territory one can
acquire but not conquer, a union of sovereign collectives, a band that
defends cloud before land, a community aligned around cryptographic
consensus, a state that recruits like a startup, a body based on math
above science, a list of citizen journalists, a culture of crypto
creators, a civilization that values digital civility, an organization
of optimalists, an asymptotically automated administration, a
ROC-based realtime regulator, a citizenry centered on single sign-on,
a polity that prizes choice alongside voice, a 100% democracy instead
of a mere 51% democracy, a society funded by subscription and
seignorage, and a nation built from the internet rather than disrupted
by it.

Whew! That's quite a list. Each of these brief definitions illuminates
a different aspect of the network state. Let's go through each of them
in turn.
** An Archipelago of Interconnected Enclaves

# |---+-----------+---------------------------+--------------|
Why might the distributed, discontiguous state shown in Figure
\ref{fig:the-network-state-dashboard} even be workable? As motivation,
start by looking at the nation states of [[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1430043293518221312][Southeast Asia]] on a map
(Figure \ref{fig:southeast-asia}).

#+CAPTION: The country of Indonesia is a set of islands separated by the ocean. What if we had a country of islands separated by the internet?
#+NAME: fig:southeast-asia
[[./assets/map-of-southeast-asia.jpeg]]

Several of these countries are clusters of islands separated by
ocean. The obvious mapping of one island per entity doesn't apply. The
boundaries aren't even close to clean [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set][convex sets]]. And there are many
pieces of Indonesia that are closer to, say, Malaysia than to other
pieces of Indonesia.

Still, on top of this messy geography people have nevertheless
superimposed the conceptual /abstraction/ of nation states. The people
within the geographic boundaries of a nation state as delimited on a
map are subject to the same laws. If they are citizens, they may have
[[https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main][logins]] on the same government services. And for the purposes of
forming contracts or adjudicating disputes, this jurisdictional
proximity takes precedence over mere geographical proximity.

That is, whether two people are citizens of the same /abstract/ nation
state is often more material than whether two people are just
/physically/ close to one another. A given Indonesian may be
physically closer to a given Malaysian than to another Indonesian 100
miles away, but the Indonesian state binds the two Indonesians
together through a common set of laws, a common currency, a common
school system, a common military, a common flag, and so on. The
abstract - might we say the /virtual/? - dominates the concrete, the
physical.

What if we extended this concept? What if those islands were separated
not by the ocean, but by the internet â€” and scattered all around the
world? That's a glimpse of what a network state looks
like. Contemporary precedents include coworking communities, crypto
meetups, and the offices of large tech companies like [[https://about.google/locations/?region=europe&office=london-6ps][Google]]: globally
distributed, networked real estate gated by the [[https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/20/google-rolls-out-beyondcorp-for-secure-remote-network-access-without-a-vpn/][common login]] of a
corporate account.

#+CAPTION: Google owns a network of commercial real estate worldwide. What if a community the size of Google owned residential real estate too?
#+NAME: fig2
[[./assets/google-offices.png]]

One difference[fn:1] is that while Google's real estate is mainly
restricted to office and datacenter space, a network state's footprint
includes community-owned residential /and/ commercial real
estate. Each piece around the world is connected to a community with
its center on the internet, forming an archipelago of interconnected
enclaves.

# TODO: import past article
# 1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country
# TODO: insert exact definition of enclave

That word - /enclave/ - is worth underlining. An enclave is a state
that is fully landlocked, surrounded by other states on all sides
without access to the ocean. The key observation is that the
/internet increases the value of networked enclaves/, of globally
distributed pieces of territory that aren't physically contiguous.

# TODO: add  references on rise of the nation state
# Imagined communities
# Invisible countries

# TODO: give examples of cliffs of dover (england/france), and then others like france/germany or contentious ones
#+CAPTION: Some national borders are more natural, in the sense that they track geographic or linguistic differences. Others are much more artificial, like the British lines dividing up Africa.
#+NAME: fig:border-examples

# TODO: show how social constructs can be psychological ones with the example of Yahoo search
# basically, the map showing that the geocenters of search queries corresponded to borders

Why? When you visualize a map of the nation states of the world, you
realize that individual enclaves aren't very common anymore. That's
because during the rise of the modern Westphalian nation state,
enclaves became far less viable. Once cartography advanced to the
point that maps were widely distributed and territory became legible,
once it became technologically feasible to first define something as
abstract[fn:9] as a national border and then to enforce it, the people
within an enclave found themselves at a disadvantage. They needed to
gain right of passage from the enclosing state to trade or travel to
other locales. Over time, it became easier for enclaves to simply
/merge/ with their enclosing state, rather than be cut off from the
world.

# TODO: give examples of enclaves being swallowed
#+CAPTION: Map of Portugal, Brazil, Macau trade routes with Spanish enclosure
#+NAME: fig:map-of-portugal-brazil-macu

Note that an entity like Portugal with access to the ocean is not
considered an enclave, even if it appears otherwise enclosed. Why?
/Because the ocean was the first peer-to-peer network./ The modern
nation state of Portugal can send ships to Portuguese-speaking regions
like Brazil or Macau without going overland through the modern nation
state of Spain. Spain cannot prevent Portugal from doing so as
interdicting ocean travel is much harder than interdicting overland
travel. So in a sense, Portugal was /networked/ to other territories
by the ocean.

What the internet does is put a port (in the digital sense) on every
device, so it can connect to each other just as the ports (in the
oceanic sense) of every maritime power connected its territories
together. That port-to-port connection opens the door for the network
state, increasing the value of an archipelago of interconnected
enclaves.
** A Country You Can Start From Your Computer
# TODO: add graphic of a path for founders and a path for citizens   
*** The Improbability of Starting a Currency
In 2008, if you'd walked into the office of a conventional
investor and said that you wanted to found a new currency from your
computer, you'd have gotten stares and guffaws.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
What are you going to do, petition the IMF? The World Bank? Oh, and
your imaginary internet money is going to be decentralized, and
deflationary, huh? You do know that Paul Krugman proved that deflation
could never work, that it'd cause liquidity traps, and even if your
crazy scheme did it'd be shut down by the government immediately. Take
a look at an Econ 101 textbook, and get out of my office.
#+END_QUOTE

Of course, Satoshi Nakamoto managed to create Bitcoin without any
investment at all[fn:8]. But this is roughly the reaction you'd get today if
you expressed a serious interest in starting a new country. And in
fairness, while of course new countries /have/ been started at various
points in history, there have also been many half-baked [[https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country][attempts]]. So
rational skepticism is warranted.
*** A Path for Founders, and a Path for Citizens
With that in mind, let's suspend disbelief and start from first
principles. An important feature of the modern era is that you can
boot up a tech company, an online community, or even a cryptocurrency
from a laptop.  Can we generalize this process of founding beyond
companies, communities, and currencies to cities and even countries?

A key concept is to start cloud first, land last - but not land
never. That is, start by founding a /community/ online and then work
on materializing it in the physical world by crowdfunding territory.

Note that not /everyone/ need be a founder of a network state. If we
think about the current world, anyone can choose to become a founder
of a company, community, or currency at any time, thereby taking on
the [[https://a16z.com/2011/10/08/nobody-cares/][immense]] [[https://future.a16z.com/the-entrepreneurial-struggle/][stress]] and risk of trying to build something from
scratch. Alternatively, they can choose to remain a "citizen" and be
gainfully employed by a founder â€” or by a vehicle that a founder once
[[https://1729.com/founding-vs-inheriting][created]], whether that be a tech founder like Larry Page or a founding
father like George Washington.

The network state model is similar. There is a path for /founders/ of
network states and a path for /citizens/. Anyone can switch between
these paths at any time, just like you can (a) go from being a Google
employee to taking on the insanity of founding a company, or (b)
transition from founding a company to selling to Google, hanging up
the cleats for a time, and enjoying the easy life as an employee.

#+CAPTION: A path for founders, a path for citizens
#+NAME: 

In other words, between any two moments in time, all four of the
following [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-transition_table][transitions]] are possible:

 1. /Citizen to Founder/. You begin gathering an online community,
    write up a founding document, create a cryptocurrency, and declare
    your intent to found a network state. From today's perspective
    this seems quixotic. But think again about Satoshi Nakamoto's plan
    to start a new currency in 2009, and how utopian it seemed at the
    time. If the process of instantiating the first network state
    meets with success, if this zero-to-one attempt actually works, it
    will eventually become a template: anyone can start a country from
    their computer, beginning by building a following.

 2. /Founder to Citizen/. You may not want to remain a founder
    forever. Heavy lies the crown! As we will see, unlike modern
    nation states, but like [[https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/06/05/why-dont-countries-buy-territory-like-they-used-to/][historical ones]], network states are built
    for full or partial M&A. So you can actually sell some or all of a
    network state to another network state, much as a large REIT might
    sell some of its properties to another REIT. A sale of this kind
    would transitions the logins of all your citizens to a new
    system. Or you can shut it down, ideally with some notice, such
    that your citizens/users have time to switch citizenship over to
    another network state.

 3. /Citizen to Citizen/. You join a network state, and remain a
    citizen. Or you acquire dual citizenship, or N-th citizenship, in
    another network state - usually by buying and holding a sufficient
    amount of that network state's coin, as well as satisfying other
    requirements like [[https://poap.xyz][participation]] and [[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1451354756639723523][civility]]. Different network
    states may have different reciprocity provisions, just like nation
    states and social networks do[fn:2]. For example, a US passport
    allows you to enter some countries, but not others. And Quora
    allows you to login with Facebook or Google, but not vice versa.
    Similarly, citizenship in one network state may give partial
    access to another network state.
	
 4. /Founder to Founder/. You continue running the network state you
    founded, or you sell or shut it down and start a new one. Perhaps
    the first such state is focused on quantified self, while the
    second is on life extension. Just like Evan Williams created
    Blogger, then Twitter, then Medium - all iterations on a theme,
    each informed by the previous one - it may be possible for a
    suitably talented administrator to do the Plymouth Colony, then
    Boston, then Massachusetts all within one lifetime. It's analogous
    to an ambitious politician starting as mayor of a city, then
    governor of a state, and then becoming president of a country.
    But think of this as the v1, v2, and v3 of communities rather than
    companies. In this context, the history of mid-1800s American
    [[https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739105207/All-Things-New-American-Communes-and-Utopian-Movements-1860-1914][communes]] is highly relevant.

#+CAPTION: The best passports are those which give maximum access to different countries.

#+CAPTION: Before the communism of the 1900s, many of the American communes of the 1800s were actually profitable and functional.
#+NAME:
[[./assets/american-communes.png]]

This takes much of the strain off the question of "who will lead a
network state"? It's like asking the question of who will be the CEO
of a tech company. It could be you. You have the right to try taking
on that immense responsibility if you want, when you want, should you
want - or to politely demur, as is your wont.
*** An Abundance of Leaders, Not an Absence Of Them 

    
The concept of empowering /anyone/ to transition back and forth
from network state founder to citizen as they see fit might seem
obvious, but it has a number of important implications.



Among other things, it offers a pragmatic alternative to the three
leading ideological positions of the day - Woke Capital (NYT),
Communist Capital (CCP), and Crypto Capital (BTC) - as the network
state is neither bureaucratic oligarchy nor communist autocracy nor
crypto-anarchy.

# TODO: make a figure showing 51% democracy vs dictatorship vs anarchy vs ~100% democracy
#       and why the network state is better for founders /and/ citizens than those three alternatives
#       all 2x2: legitimacy without competency - san francisco
#                competency without legitimacy - ccp dictatorship
#                neither legitimate nor competent - crypto anarchy
#                legitimate and competent - network state founder

1. /100% Democracy, not 51% Democracy./ First, when anyone can become
   a network state founder or switch citizenships, that's not an
   argument against democracy, it's an argument for /more/ of it. It's
   about more individual input, more consensual government, and more
   international inclusiveness. Put another way, it's a case for 100%
   democracy, rather than a mere 51% democracy. Because in the 100%
   democracy of a network state, all the citizens in a jurisdiction
   have freely chosen the founder by signing a social smart contract
   upon entry. By contrast, in the status quo of a 51% democracy we
   see the barest possible level of democratic assent, and a
   corresponding grudging reluctance by 49% to bend to coercion by the
   other 51%. In this sense the network state is an alternative to the
   bureaucratic oligarchy imposed by NYT in the name of democracy.

2. /Legitimate Leadership, not Communist Dictatorship./ Second, when
   anyone can become a network state founder, but must attract
   citizens, that's not an argument against competent leadership. It's
   an argument for /legitimate/ leadership, leadership that citizens
   have freely chosen, much as they freely work for a CEO or vote for
   a president. It's leadership without dictatorship: anyone can
   declare themselves a leader of a network state, and see whether
   they can build a following, just like they can declare themselves
   founder of a tech company and see whether they can build a product
   valuable enough to fund employees. The alternative is the
   non-consensuality of imposed direction by communist dictatorship,
   the CCP model, where China's international cities and greatest
   entrepreneurs are being crushed in the name of making China great
   on the international stage.

3. /Crypto-Civilization, not Crypto-Anarchy./ Third, when we we
   actively seek founders, rather than reject them on principle,
   that's not an argument against decentralization, it's an argument
   for crypto-civilization over crypto-anarchy. It's a recognition
   that Satoshi was a leader, Washington was a leader, Gandhi was a
   leader, Lee Kuan Yew was a leader, and Herzl was a leader. And that
   a stably decentralized world requires an abundance of leaders, not
   an absence of them, lest a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOWRembdPS8][highly organized]] centralized empire
   overwhelm a group of disorganized crypto-anarchists that reject the
   very concept of leadership.

Thus, at least conceptually, the network state embraces democracy,
leadership, and decentralization while avoiding the failure modes of
oligarchy, dictatorship, and anarchy. There are no royal titles
either; there's no hereditary monarchy, no newspaper nepotists, PRC
princelings, or corporate feudalists at the head of things. A leader
earns their way to the top, generating enough value for their digital
citizens - or seeing them leave for another network state given the
ease of exit. And a key to it all is that fluidity of transition: a
network state is a country you can start from your computer, so anyone
can go from citizen to founder.
*** 96% of the World Can't Become President, But 100% Can Found A Network State.
The idea that anyone can become a founder of a network state is a
vision of global equality of opportunity. It is the modern version of
Jefferson's natural aristocracy. And it's an improvement over America's
legitimating myth that "anyone can become president of the United
States", which isn't really true, as only ~4% of the world is American
and only a subset of those satisfy the age, birth, and residency
[[https://www.usa.gov/presidents][requirements]] to become president.

#+CAPTION: US rules the world
#+NAME:

So long as the US still [[https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321/][rules the world]], this means that most of the
people the US rules cannot themselves rise to rule the US. In fact,
once we realize that there have been only 46 US presidents (all of
whom are American), but that there are thousands of billionaires (most
of whom are now [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_billionaires][not American]], we realize that it is /much more
realistic/[fn:5] to become a tech billionare than to become US
president.

#+CAPTION: 
#+NAME:
[[./assets/global-billionaire-list.png]]

Similarly, now that Satoshi made it possible to start a new digital
currency, it is much easier to found a new cryptocurrency than to
become head of the Federal Reserve. The American establishment would
never have picked Vitalik Buterin over Jerome Powell, but the young
Canadian is on key dimensions a far more accomplished macroeconomist
than the American sexagenarian. Buterin founded an economy, while
Powell simply [[https://1729.com/founding-vs-inheriting][inherited one]].

So, instead of the false hope of getting elected US president, a role
available only to 46 people in history, or the even more difficult
path of becoming Fed Chair, an opportunity for only 16 appointees, one
can much more realistically found a billion dollar company or coin
from one's computer.

By extending this concept, we allow anyone in the world with an
internet connection (which will soon be everyone) to become not just a
tech founder, or a protocol founder, but a network state
founder. Whether the next Washington is Brazilian, Indian, Nigerian,or
Eastern European, this mechanism lets them rise to global
leadership. It permits a positive-sum avenue for the politically
ambitious. But, again, it also allows anyone who doesn't desire the
stress of leadership, or just doesn't desire it at this point in time,
to simply remain a citizen and pick from their available nation and
network state jurisdictions.

Snapchat lies on a straight line with the dissolution of the nation
state. Why? Because people are sharing intimate moments with others
3000 miles away, while they often don't know the names of the people next
door in their anonymous urban apartment complex.

This undermines the underlying assumption of the Westphalian nation
state: namely, that people who live near each other will share the
same values and therefore agree upon laws, such that the
geographically-premised mechanism of the nation state is the right
entity to govern them. Instead, what we find is that people share
values with people who are close to them in their social network...not
in their physical vicinity. We cannot be a good neighbor if we do not
even know the neighbors.

# TODO: do an example with great circle distance and geodesic distance
#       for a group of (say) 5 people. Show that the clusters are different.
#       Eg: there's a CA cluster and India cluster in the physical world,

#
#       v1: geographical proximity, v2: network proximity, v3:
#       migration to people of like mind

We can quantify this with a little math. First, take a look at the
definitions for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance][great circle distance]] and the [[https://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/C7_Connection.html#geodesic][geodesic distance]].

#+CAPTION: The great circle distance is the number of kilometers apart on a globe, as the crow flies.
#+NAME:
[[./assets/great-circle-distance.png]]

# TODO: ramachandran 2005 paper with overland travel times for better distance metric

The great circle distance is the the distance between two points on the
surface of the earth. It's the distance as the crow flies. You can do
a modified version of this based on practical travel constraints, but
to a first approximation this is how far apart people are in the
physical world.

#+CAPTION: The geodesic distance is the number of degrees of separation in a social network.
#+NAME:
[[./assets/geodesic-distance.jpg]]

The geodesic distance, by contrast, is a completely different
metric. It's the number of degrees of separation between two nodes in
a social network along the shortest path.

Importantly, the geodesic distance is just as valid a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)#Definition][mathematical
metric]] as the great-circle distance. That means one can generate
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix][distance matrices]], and hence maps, via techniques like
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling#Classical_multidimensional_scaling][multidimensional scaling]]. In fact, there are entire [[http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=21262&copyownerid=34837][conferences]]
devoted to cloud cartography, in which [[http://vis.stanford.edu/jheer/projects/vizster/][research]] [[https://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume1/Freeman.html][groups]] present maps of
online social networks - mapping not nation states but states of mind.

#+CAPTION: A map of a social network based on the geodesic distance.
#+NAME:
[[./assets/social-network-map.png]]

Why is the geodesic distance important? Because the network state is
enabled in nontrivial part by the fact that we are transitioning from
a primarily great-circle-driven world to a graph-geodesic-driven world. And
that means the fundamental division is less the visible geographic
borders of the nation state, than the invisible geodesic borders of
the social network. This in turn means that we need to reconceptualize
the state as a primarily digital entity, a /network state/.

#+CAPTION: With Russia, the land is fixed and the ideology is variable. With Ethereum it's the reverse.
#+NAME:
[[./assets/russia-vs-ethereum.png]]

Think about the difference between Russia vs Ethereum. Russia was a
geographical entity that switched its ideology in 1991, from communism
to nationalism. The geography was primary, the ideology was
secondary. Conversely, Ethereum is an ideological entity whose primary
existence is in a network. The Ethereum community holds meetups in
places like Cancun or Shenzhen, but the physical materialization is
evanescent while the digital community is persistent.

Or think about the fact that Russia's borders are (mostly) fixed,
while Ethereum's borders are highly fluid. It's true that Russia's
borders have changed since 1991; its predecessor state, the USSR,
extended farther out into Eastern Europe and Central Asia. But the
Russian people have been near the Baltics, the Turks, the Eastern
Europeans, and so on for quite a long time. Geopolitics doesn't vary
that much; Russia's "competitors" for citizens have mostly stayed the
same.

By contrast, the Ethereum-to-XYZ exchange rate /does/ vary quite a
bit, for different values of XYZ. Solana is a new digital currency
that has popped up on Ethereum's boundary and taken a good chunk of
"citizens" from it, just as Ethereum itself rose in BTC terms since
its inception.

This is similar to how early Facebook arose out of nowhere and took
many "citizens" from Gmail, before Google "closed the borders". Of
course, unlike territorial disputes, competitions over digital
citizens are not strictly zero-sum. For at least a while, the space of
cryptocurrency and internet users will keep expanding; even after that
point, a rival still needs to build better services to attract a
competitor's digital citizens.

It is the geodesic distance that enables fluid switching between
network states[fn:6]. The great-circle-distance-driven physical world
requires individuals to actually move around the map to enter a new
territory, while the geodesic-distance-griven digital world just
requires a user to hit a new key. This becomes more obvious when you
have a VR headset on; hit a button and you are transported between
worlds. Another button, another world.

And this applies not just to individuals, but to whole groups, to
entire networks, which are expensive to move in the physical world but
much easier to relocate near another network in digital space. Just do
an Oauth-style integration and voila, your citizens can cross the
border into another network state.

Legacy nation states cannot do this. They cannot just move around the
map at will. As we noted, the Russian state is mostly stuck with its
neighbors like Japan and Turkey in a way that individual Russians, or
the Telegram and Ethereum networks (both founded by people of Russian
descent), are not.

We can term this concept /digital dynamic geography/, after a term
Patri Friedman [[https://patrifriedman.com/old_writing/dynamic_geography.html][introduced]]. He used it in the context of seasteading,
to argue for homes like cruise ships that could dock and undock in
congenial states at will, but it's arguably easier to accomplish first
in the digital world. For a group organized by geodesic distance,
collective digital exit is as easy as pressing a key.

# And
# the popularization of the metaverse makes this more than a metaphor;
# the digital territory a network inhabits can instantly be picked up
# and made adjacent to any other with the press of a key, just like
# moving a cruise ship around the world, but even more cheaply and
# quickly.

user[fn:4] behind them. To first order, the right answer would be "all
of them". But had a Facebook flag gone up in each window as Facebook
grew, people would have perceived it differently. It'd be more
tangible; the scale of Facebook would have been obvious earlier
on, and the backlash would have been stronger. There's something about
peripheral vision that activates the human sense of scale in a way
mere numbers on screen doesn't. Seeing the number "100,000" is very
different from seeing a stadium of 100,000 people.

** A Territory One Can Acquire but Not Conquer
Once we visualize a network state as a combination of (a) a digital
social network with an integrated cryptocurrency and (b) a physical
network of distributed enclaves, we realize that it is much easier to
acquire than to conquer.

# TODO: visual of M&A of a network state
#       might want to start with a sequence of visuals
#       showing setup, expansion, digital and physical footprints

*** Easy to Acquire
First, why is it easy to acquire? For the digital portion of a network
state, when the founder sells it to an acquirer, it's like selling
Instagram to Facebook. The digital logins of the two services are
integrated and citizens in each network state now have access to the
other's apps and physical territory. This is a modern analog to the
Louisiana Purchase or the purchase of Alaska. It's also feasible to
sell not the entire network, but simply a subnetwork - perhaps all
those in a defined geographical location,or all those who have
expressed a collective interest in changing citizenship. This is
similar to Singapore becoming independent from Malaysia. Finally, it
is also feasible to spin off a subnetwork into its own network, like
the UK exiting from the EU.

#+CAPTION: 
#+NAME:
[[./assets/lousiana-purchase.jpeg]]

If we visualize the physical portion of a network state as like a
network of Google offices, or a string of restaurant chains, or the
real estate footprint of a REIT, we see how we can handle the physical
component of network state M&A as well. In the simplest version, after
one network state consummates the acquisition of the other, all
citizens from one network state can enter the territory of the
other. The smart locks just get a software update and now open all the
doors and gates. The branding changes too, to be consistent with the
new unified entity, much like a large hotel chain putting up new signage
when it acquires a small one. Various kinds of reciprocity
relationships with other network states and third parties may need to
be renegotiated, just like many corporate contracts have change-of-control
provisions, but this is straightforward so long as it is anticipated.

#+CAPTION: 
#+NAME:
[[./assets/restaurant-chains-map.jpeg]]

In theory, all of this can be done with current technical and legal
infrastructure. It's just like one multinational acquiring the
digital, physical, and human resources of another, except it extends
to people's residences rather than simply their offices, and except
that the acquired people become not just remote employees of the
combined entity but digital citizens - though they can always leave
for any new network state that admits them.

Over time, however, the technolegal infrastructure for each network
state should live on a blockchain rather than a melange of paper
contracts and cloud services. The reason is that a blockchain gives
citizen accounts and balances, allows the recording of all real estate
transactions, the maintenance of all citizen records, and the
management of private keys in a globally consistent way across legacy
nation state jurisdictions. The problem of post-acquisition
integration then reduces to porting over the records from one chain to
another.

In summary, this is a way to extend the corporate concept of
change-of-control to polities. It's a recipe for nonviolent
competition between countries, where peace treaties between would-be
rebels and current incumbents are turned into M&A deals.

*** Hard to Conquer
The network state reduces violence on another dimension: thanks to
their geographical decentralization and physical invisiblity, network
states are hard to conquer.
**** Network States are Geographically Decentralized
First, geographical decentralization. If you look at a map of
France that includes its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_France][islands]] in the South Pacific, you realize
that it's difficult to nuke or attack the whole thing at once. It's
too globally distributed. So the geographical distribution of the
network state itself is a deterrent to physical force. Just like
cryptocurrency, the decentralization deters violence.

#+CAPTION: France is concentrated in Western Europe. But it has about a million citizens around the globe.
#+NAME:
[[./assets/global-france-map.png]]

Put another way, invading a network state is like invading every
Bitcoin mine or Ethereum node in the world at once. Are you really
going to be able to get right-of-way for your troops from every
surrounding territory?  Won't the collateral damage piss off the
neighbors? And how will you even locate all the nodes in the first
place? Because the list isn't public.
**** Network States are Physically Invisible
This brings us to the second way that network states deter
violence: physical invisibility. It's a bit more subtle. Right now, you
can see the physical border between France & Germany on a map. But you
can't visualize the border between Twitter & Facebook. That is, which
people are on the "border" of Twitter and Facebook, in the sense that
they have accounts on both sites?

This might seem like a trivial concept, but isn't. The Twitter and
Facebook networks are each bigger than France or Germany -
combined. However, social network membership is invisible to all but
the network operators. There's no public list of all Facebook and
Twitter members. Only Facebook can generate a [[https://i.stack.imgur.com/6dXmx.jpg][map like this]].

#+CAPTION: A map of Facebook's 'citizens' from the early 2010s.
#+NAME:
[[./assets/facebook-map.jpeg]]

The invisibility of network membership has immense implications. You
couldn't have nationalism itself without maps of physical space. For
example, think about 54Â° 40' or Fight, which made literal reference to
latitude. You couldn't have that kind of border dispute without being
able to visualize a border. People had to see the map to be able to
fight over it.

So, because citizenship in a network state is invisible to a
satellite, at least without the consent of the network state operator,
these [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community][imagined communities]] are [[https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300221626/invisible-countries][invisible countries]]. It's the return of
secret societies, at scale, as /secret states/. Network states thus
reduce violence by encrypting the map itself; you can't hit what you
can't see.

This is particularly interesting when it comes to the threat of
invasions, and the use of nuclear weapons. If a network state of ten
million people was spread around the globe, with a partially private
user list (like Twitter and Facebook) and a physically decentralized
footprint (like Bitcoin miners and Google offices), it'd be difficult
to nuke it, or invade it, even if you could find it. You'd impose a
lot of collateral damage on the people nearby in unaffiliated network
states, you'd spend a lot of money, and the remaining 90-95% of
citizens of the network state would likely seek some form of
retaliation.

That's not to say that network states are invulnerable. The types of
attacks that could hit the entirety of a rival network state would be
a cyberattack of some kind on their blockchain backbone, or perhaps a
drone swarm (or perhaps SEAL team) that could be coordinated around
the world given the GPS coordinates of every citizen.

But that's a different battlefield than the one today's militaries are
prepared for. Special forces and cyber notwithstanding, they are still
for the most part organized around tanks, planes, and aircraft
carriers. But if the map goes dark, the network state itself becomes
invisible, the nuclear weapons and invasions of the 20th century are
less applicable, and cyberwar and drone strikes become fundamental,
then the cloud becomes the primary theater of war - not air, sea, or
land.

** A Community Aligned Around Cryptographic Consensus
# people: alignment: coins, truth
# a community aligned around cryptographic consensus, 
   
Today's nation states are typically either internally disaligned,
like the US, or forcibly internally aligned, like China. In the first
case, the citizens are arguably free, but strongly disagree. In the
second case, the citizens are in key respects less free, and thus do
not openly disagree.

#+CAPTION: The US is internally disaligned.
#+NAME:
[[./assets/pew-polarization.png]]

The ideal is a third way, to build a community which is consensually
internally aligned, where the citizens have made a free choice to
agree, and have working mechanisms to come to consensus in the event
they disagree[fn:7].

That last bit is the hard part. In the US, polarization (or
decentralization) has been increasing since the mid-century peak
centralization, and was accelerated by social media. The establishment
attempted a counter-decentralization to try to censor and deplatform
people from social media, but this is unsystematic and, after an
initial surge, halfhearted. It's an amateurish retrofit of speech and
thought controls upon a previously free society, and it increasingly
seems like it's not going to stick, particularly with the emergence of
semi-decentralized platforms like Substack, fully decentralized tools
like Bitcoin, and censorship-resistant web3 tools like Mirror, IPFS,
and the like. America's model is no consensus and constant dissent.

In China, unification (or centralization) has arguably been increasing
since mid-century, when there was the nadir of the Chinese Civil War,
when many of the most talented Chinese people sought their fortunes
abroad, and when the most successful ethnically Chinese states were
the islands outside mainland China: Hong Kong, Taiwan, and
Singapore. Over the last several decades, like an ultra-aggressive
sheepdog, the Chinese government has ensured that any burgeoning
dissent is stifled, whether that be Tiananmen Square, the Great
Firewall, Falun Gong, Bo Xilai, the Hong Kong National Security Law,
the Xinjiang crackdown, US-supported democracy activists, Chinese tech
founders, or Bitcoin miners. China's model is to attain consensus by
suppressing dissent.

What's the better model? A combination of old-fashioned ideas like
trust and communication, plus newer ideas like the cryptographic
consensus that the blockchain permits.

After all, we should recognize that an Israeli and a Palestinian, a
Chinese person and a Japanese person, a Democrat and a Republican, all
agree on the state of the Bitcoin blockchain. Regardless of their
political views, or geography, people agree on how much Bitcoin
someone has globally. This is an incredible triumph, because a
trillion dollars is the kind of thing people will fight over. For
wealth on the scale of a trillion dollars, people will invade
countries, forge histories, do crazy things. Indeed, a "mere"
million dollars is the kind of thing people will fight over. Yet
thereâ€™s essentially no dispute on who owns what BTC. 

The same consensus algorithms that can get people to agree on what
Bitcoin someone had at what time can be extended to get people to
agree on what digital property somebody had at what time. That's
stocks and bonds, but also things like art and video game items,
and the digital keys to real world homes and vehicles.

Finally, and less obviously, these consensus algorithms can be
extended not simply to recording property, but to arbitrary kinds of
timestamped information. What device recorded this temperature in
Kansas on this date? What hospital uploaded this medical record to the
blockchain at this time? What was the price of this house that was
sold in this area? What crime was reported by this victim or this
police officer in this area?

All of these feeds of data did not really exist two decades ago. They
mostly do exist today, but in corporate silos. The next step is to put
them on-chain and integrate them into what we call the /ledger of
record/, which is a global feed of cryptographically timestamped,
undeletable history.

If you think about how people use Twitter, they use it as a reference
to prove that something happened, that someone said something at a given time.
Twitter is in this sense a timestamped feed of events, one where we
trust Twitter to tell us what happened. But this is imperfect for
many reasons, not least of which that Twitter deplatforms many people,
and has been hacked in ways that allow impersonation of users. 

If a Twitter-style feed was on-chain, no one can man-in-the-middle
attack or deplatform the users. They could steal the keys, but that
would mean stealing property too. So it becomes harder to falsify
history. The feed of what happened becomes harder to corrupt. And this
is the transition from centralized truth, from the corporate "truth"
of the American press and the official "truth" of the Chinese state to
decentralized cryptographic truth, on-chain truth, truth you can
verify for yourself.

This kind of truth is already used by crypto oracles like Chainlink to
manage feeds of information that are the input to smart contracts
handling billions of dollars. While price feeds may seem like a highly
specific area to begin, they are ideal from one vantage point: if
you can corrupt even one byte, you can hack a lot of money. So
if you can create a defensible, hack-proof history there,
you can extend it to protect many other kinds of history.

This is how we get to a community aligned around cryptographic consensus.

people applying to countries at the age of 18, much as they apply to
colleges today at the age of 18, and for many of the same
reasons. Over time we can apply technology to reducing the barrier to
exit, and thereby reducing the need for financial aid. In this
fashion, the network state is a state that recruits like a startup, or
like a competitive college.

** A Citizenry Centered On Single Sign-On
# netizen of the network state
# citizen of a nation state
# Citizenship *is* single sign-on
# That's what it means to be a US citizen abroad
# You carry a passport and various documents
# These indicate you are a citizen. That's the local version
# And there are entries in government databases that confirm this. That's the server side version
# Those are of course 20th century implementations of a very 21st century concept
# Citizenship is about holding the requisit private keys, and having corresponding entries in a database (eventually, a blockchain)
# why a blockchain? because it can protect valuable information. such as bitcoin, of course, but also anything people would want to forge
   
In many ways, we can think of modern citizenship as being /defined/ by
access to a single sign-on service like Singpass, as opposed to
physical proximity to another person per se.

#+CAPTION: The Singpass gives every Singaporean citizen a login to all services.
#+NAME:
[[./assets/singpass.png]]

As we've mentioned, the backbone of the network state is likely a
blockchain, whether that be permissionless, permissioned, or some
variant thereof. Why? Because it can be used to replace the following
services of a legacy nation state.

 - /Identity card/: Your private keys give your user account and login
   to the digital services of the network state. It all starts here,
   with the new single sign-on for citizens. Like ENS's satoshi.eth,
   you'd have an official name like yourname.countrychain.

 - /The Social Contract/: The metaphorical social contract becomes a
   literal social smart contract that you sign every time you want to
   re-up your subscription to the network state. There are explicit
   contract terms, multiple choice questions to ensure that you
   understand those contract terms, reviews of the contract terms by
   other competing network states, and so on.
 
 - /Passport/: Your private keys, the network state's foreign
   relations, and the technological state of chain interoperability
   determine what other network states you can access.

 - /Voting/: Every vote, shareholder vote, poll, or survey is done via
   digital signature using your private keys. Sophisticated kinds of
   privacy-preserving votes can be done with this infrastructure.

 - /Governance/: Should you be elected or appointed to office, your
   private keys determine your permission level, in terms of what
   budget you have as governor of a subgraph of the network state, or
   what actions you can take towards untoward citizens, such as
   deplatforming for 10 days after a first warning.

 - /Crime and Punishment/: On this topic, different network states
   will make different decisions here, but unlike the lawless
   deplatforming of today's social media platforms, digital
   punishments /could/ be more humane and acceptable than physical
   punishments so long as there are /clear and pre-agreed rules/ that
   all members of the network state abide by at the time of joining.

 - /Driver's License, Pilot's License/: Your private keys determine
   which smart vehicles you can operate, either in person (eg a Tesla)
   or remotely (eg a drone).

 - /Security Clearance/: Your private keys determine whether you have
   Top Secret clearance, and in general whether you have permission to
   view any given document, enter a facility, or interact with any
   digital object.

 - /Postal Service/: Your private keys give encrypted p2p and group
   messaging. Note that the Postal Service was in the US Constitution!

 - /Fund Recovery and Lawful Intercept/: This is a controversial area,
   and different network states will make different decisions
   here. But if the network state founder has admin keys, it may be able
   to do /lawful intercept/ of some messages or reversal of fund
   transfers after a pre-agreed social process, which proceeds
   on-chain and thus more transparently than the status quo of star
   chambers and civil forfeitures.

   Why even mention this? Because it's an open question as to how to
   deal with crime in a network state. The fact that the United States
   and other governments have abused their police powers and are
   likely beyond reform does not mean that the complete absence of
   lawful authority is the right answer; that path leads to
   crypto-anarchy and criminal gangs. The right answer is a new
   network state where you can choose to trust it and revoke that
   trust and exit to a new network state should it abuse it.

   Here's another way to think about it: as a user of a crypto
   exchange, you want complete privacy. But as the CEO of a crypto
   exchange, you want complete analytics on every user. Why? Because
   some users /are/ genuinely seeking to harm or defraud other users,
   and you may need tools like Sift Science to determine who they are,
   and to ban them from the platform.

 - /Defensive Border Walls/: So long as your chain is sufficiently
   sovereign resistant, no other entity besides the network state
   itself can penetrate the cryptography protecting your citizens'
   messages and possessions.   
 
 - /Name Change/: Seemingly trivial, but less so in the pseudonymous
   economy. Your private keys let you do this as well.

 - /Signatures and Notarization/: Your private keys allow digital
   signatures and, via multisig, notarization of others' signatures.

 - /Community Trust/: A web-of-trust network of on-chain endorsements
   serves as a computable measure of community trust, like a higher
   stakes form of friending or following.

 - /Corporate Law/: Most corporate law can go on-chain. See this post
   mirrortables for details: balajis.com/mirrortables.

 - /Dispute Resolution/: Smart contracts give more predictable dispute
   resolution.

 - /Land Registry/: Cadestration and land registries can be put on
   chain. Even more interestingly, any land use permits can be put on
   chain, as can community ownership of land through a REIT, in a sort
   of neo-Georgist configuration. 
   
 - /Crowdfunding for public goods/: All of this can be organized on
   chain, potentially with traditional crowdfunding and possibly with
   commemorative NFTs where the largest bidders get their names on a
   digital plaque.

 - /Currency/: The internal currency or currencies of the network
   state are of course on-chain, as are any bonds or other securities
   it issues to finance its operations.
   
 - /Taxes/: these turn into (a) subscription fees paid on chain and
   (b) Bitcoin-checked inflation of the network state's native
   currency. The subscription concept is intuitive; it's the annual
   payment for being a member of the network state. The inflation
   component is less obvious. Isn't the whole point to get away from
   inflation? The idea here is that this "inflation" is highly
   visible, and more like a fundraising round where new shares are
   issued and closely scrutinized than the current hijinks the Federal
   Reserve prints trillions of dollars and then hides the
   scoreboard. In the event any network state tries to inflate its
   currency too much, the citizens cash out to Bitcoin, which thus
   acts as a kind of pro-freedom global government.

 - /Birth, Marriage, and Death Certificates/: All of these go on chain
   too. Everything that the city is asserting is true as an oracle.

 - /Property Rights/: user balances for all assets where the network
   state mediates disputes go on the network state's
   blockchain. Notably, BTC is /not/ included in that list, as Bitcoin
   stands above the network state on its own blockchain as a check on
   every state.

This gives you a sense of where city coins can go. They eventually
become city-state coins, and network state coins.

** A Society Funded by Subscription and Seignorage
Just to preface this section: to be clear, the network state starts as
a non-sovereign entity, an imaginary construct, a LARP. Each netizen
of the network state, and each network node, is expected to comply
with the laws of its surrounding host state for the indefinite future.

But suspend disbelief and assume we can wave a magic wand. Assume we
can eventually gain a degree of /legal/ sovereignty for the network
state by collective bargaining with a host state, perhaps by paying
them a fee or otherwise working with them.

For example, a set of network nodes in the vicinity of Tuvalu might do
a deal with Tuvalu similar to the purchase of the .tv domain. They
might pay the Tuvalese (say) $X million annualy for the privilege of
being considered a Tuvalu special economic zone and setting their own
revenue policy.

What could that revenue policy look like?

As context, current nation states are based on (a) coercive revenue
collection, (b) financial surveillance, (c) bond-fueled debt, and (d)
hidden inflation. The network state is set up to be financially
solvent and ethically strong from the beginning by avoiding each of
these pitfalls.
*** Subscription > Coercion
The primary source of revenue for a network state is 
subscriptions[fn:10]. Each netizen pays for the citizenship-as-a-service
single sign on.

If they do not renew their subscription, their single sign-on is
turned off, and they end up being unable to enter buildings or log
in. This is enough incentive for them to remain compliant with the
terms of the social smart contract they signed upon entering. The
blockchain handles the various details of nonviolent contract
enforcement.

Importantly, as the cost of coercion rises, these types of
subscriptions will end up being more profitable than traditional means
of coercive revenue collection.

Why? Because if an illegitimate state like Venezuela tries to
implement something like civil forfeiture on a national scale, if they
tried to do Lenin's Hanging Order in the age of Bitcoin, they will
need to ensure that each act of seizure must pay for itself. That is,
they need to deanonymize each 'kulak', geolocate them, ensure they
have jurisdiction, send in the SWAT team, successfully execute the
wrench attack, collect the Bitcoin, and then repeat this over and
over again in many places while managing the PR fallout.

The key concept is that each such act by a Venezuela-style gangster
state must generate more Bitcoin than it costs. It is not obvious that
this will be the case as physical attacks are far less reproducible
than the practice of simply hitting a key and printing money. And they
are also less profitable than the new proposed practice of simply
rendering a valuable enough citizenship service that people will
consensually renew their subscription.
*** Privacy > Surveillance
There's a second reason why subscriptions will be preferred over the
current mechanism of invasive data collection and financial
surveillance: namely, privacy.

You don't need to fill out endless numbers of forms to pay
Dropbox. You certainly don't need to spend hours giving them a
snapshot of your entire corporate and/or personal financial picture in
order to pay them a percentage of your income, thereby risking your
privacy further should Dropbox get hacked. You just pay Dropbox a flat
monthly fee for services rendered, and cancel it if you don't like it.

Compare this to the state of affairs for states. Major government
agencies are routinely hacked to an unbelievable degree.  The OPM
Hack, the Texas state hack, and the Solarwinds hack are just a few
that have been publicly reported. If it has not already happened, it
will likely soon occur that your personal financial information is
sprayed over the internet by a hack of an incompetent government
agency. The cloud may burst, with all this information raining down
upon the internet. Add to this the surveillance state that one cannot
opt out of, and the potential for abuse becomes clear.

So the network state starts with an alternative principle: minimal
necessary data collection. Governments should not collect what they
cannot secure. The subscription state protects financial privacy
relative to the existing system.
*** Sovereign Equity > Sovereign Debt
While subscriptions are expected to be the main source of funds,
another mechanism network states can use to raise capital is
/seignorage/. Specifically, much like a company issues new stock, the
network state issues new units of its digital asset on its main
blockchain.

Unlike the current process of secretive and random inflation, this is
more akin to the highly ritualized ceremony around stock issuance that
occurs when a company raises a new funding round. In such a ritual,
the exact number of new shares is specified to the unit, the exact
purchasers are known, the terms of those shares are detailed, the new
liquidation waterfall is updated, and so on. If these terms are not
agreeable to the purchasers of equity, then they walk, and the round
is not completed.

Compare this to the current practice of lawlessly printing trillions,
watching M2 ramp, then complaining that it doesn't measure anything,
thereby acknowledging that there are zero dashboards to monitor the
flow of trillions into the economy. Or the practice of encouraging
many entities to buy "debt" in the form of negative interest rate
yielding US bonds, even as it becomes obvious that the long term
strategy is to monetize the debt by printing so much money that the
bonds become worthless.
*** Bitcoin > Inflation
The third governor of the network state's financial solvency is
Bitcoin. This works in several ways.

First, because the Bitcoin blockchain is so difficult to interfere
with, we can think of it as a form of property that even the world's
most powerful legacy states can't stop. In this sense, Bitcoin is a
global government that checks all other states, network and nation
state alike.

So, any investor who doesn't like a network state's seignorage
practices can cash out to BTC, which cannot be issued by any network
state. Any citizen can do the same. This is similar to how an investor
who doesn't like a company's practices can cash out to USD.

Moreover, each network state itself holds Bitcoin as a strategic
reserve, which cannot be seized by any other state. Having funds
on-chain also allows a network state to demonstrate proof-of-reserve.

Of course, a network state will hold more than Bitcoin, just as
traditional states held more than just gold. Each network state
decides what digital assets are held in its portfolio, and which are
approved for its medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of
value.
** COMMENT A Nation Built From The Internet Rather Than Disrupted By It

** Summary and FAQ
As you can see, we've put some thought into how to make the network
state feasible. The concept has been defined to address many of the
immediate questions - and emotional interjections - that arise when
you discuss the concept of starting a new country.

  1. /What is a network state, anyway?/. We defined the network state
     as a social network with a recognized founder, an integrated
     cryptocurrency, a definite purpose, a sense of national
     consciousness, and a plan to crowdfund territory. It's a country
     you can start from your computer. There is a path for founders,
     and a path for citizens, as anyone can declare themselves founder
     or citizen of a network state at any time, and also switch
     between these roles.

  2. /How should we think about nation states?/ The root word of
     nation is related to the word natality, which refers to
     birth. That is, a nation is considered to be an ethnic group with
     common culture, inheritance, language, traditions, etc. The state
     by contrast is the government. So in the classic nation state, an
     ethnic group like the Japanese (the nation) names leaders (the
     state) to manage disputes, collective defense, and the like. The
     Jewish community by contrast was for a long time a nation without
     a territory or a formal state, until the establishment of
     Israel. And today we have multiethnic nation states like
     Singapore, Luxembourg, and the USA, which generalize the concept
     beyond the historical ethnostate, and where the state becomes
     more primary. In the latter case the defining principle is really
     a /proposition/, rather than a /nation/, but this is a retrofit
     on what was previously an ethnostate. A major issue today is that
     the internet is accelerating the decay of the Western nation
     state by making long-distance bonds over networks more salient
     than geographical ties between neighbors.

  3. /Why is a network now a better basis for a state than a nation?/
     If we're going to build a proposition nation, we should be honest
     about it and recruit on the basis of that proposition from the
     beginning. Many Western countries today demonstrate the level of
     dissatisfaction that occurs on both sides when what was arguably
     implicitly an ethnostate is converted to a proposition nation
     with less than 100% assent. By instead /starting/ with a group of
     people defined by geodesic rather over geographic distance, we
     have a base population which is close together in an ideological
     sense and thereby much more likely to agree on what the state
     should do. By also articulating the proposition explicitly, we
     have a defined purpose, an objective that we are literally
     quantitatively optimizing as a society of optimalists. All
     recruiting is then for that purpose.
     
  4. /Why don't you just reform existing institutions?/ We want to be
     able to start new countries for the same reason people want a
     clean sheet of paper, an empty text buffer, a bare piece of land,
     or a fresh cap table. It's a clean start without legacy
     baggage. Think of the network state as a way to build
     replacements to reform-resistant legacy institutions that can't
     be easily disrupted by tech companies, open source projects, or
     crypto protocols. If those replacements actually succeed, then
     our exit actually enhances voice. That is, if we are successful
     in what we're doing, that gives ammo for people to reform
     existing institutions, much as many practices were pioneered in
     America and imported back to the old world.

  5. /Why do you consider this an ethical imperative?/ Suppose you're
     interested in improving longevity and thereby life expectancy.
     It takes 12 years and billions of dollars to get a drug through
     the FDA. And it might literally be faster and cheaper to start a
     new country than to reform such a sclerotic bureaucracy. This is
     the concept behind building a ROC-based realtime regulator, a
     regulator that quantifies approval decisions like a binary
     classifier and tries to minimize type I and II errors.
     
  6. /How will you get land, if it's all spoken for?/. The short
     version is that we crowdfund discontiguous territory around the
     world and network it together into an archipelago of
     interconnected enclaves. A network state can thus can be
     visualized in a dashboard, and you can watch it grow over time.

  7. /Why is this not cosplaying like all the other failed
     micronations?/. The key difference is that we start by building
     functional communities online. We aren't just starting with a
     patch of territory, we're starting with the network as the
     equivalent of the nation, and then building a state in the cloud
     before it materializes on the land. As for the LARPing part, (a)
     we just LARPed cryptocurrency to a trillion and (b) all countries
     start as imagined countries. For example, Herzl wrote Der
     Judenstaadt in the 1890s, five decades before the formation of
     Israel.
    
  8. /You do know we'll invade you if you do it, and we'll also
     denounce you if you have any plan for defense?/. As noted above,
     the network state has nonviolent defense in depth. It's a
     city-state with its capital in the cloud, and its territory is
     globally decentralized so it can't easily be invaded. It might
     even be a secret state, with an encrypted membership list and set
     of network nodes, so it can't even be easily found. It can
     however be bought and sold, with the consent of a sufficient
     number of coinholders, so it is a territory one can acquire but
     not conquer.

  9. /What about humanities and culture, techbro?!?/ Glad you asked so
     politely. Of course, when we think of France, we don't think of
     the French Stock Exchange. We think of the Louvre and the Eiffel
     Tower, we think of the Mona Lisa and baguettes, we think of their
     art, culture, and food. So too will every network state need its
     own artists, writers, bards, and chefs. In the modern era we'll
     think of these as /crypto creators/, who own their art and
     audience via private keys unlike mere internet influencers. These
     crypto creators help attract new citizens to each network state
     and define its culture and value proposition. Phrased humorously,
     you can fund the Eiffel Tower with afffiliate revenue from
     citizen referrals. This gives a sustainable business model for
     the arts.

  10. /How do you think about legitimacy and consent?/ The network
      state is a 100% democracy rather than a mere 51% democracy.
      That means that every netizen signs a social smart contract upon
      entering the digital (and eventually physical) environment, kind
      of like Envoy. They then periodically re-evaluate the terms at
      the time of subscription renewal, or reject them in order to
      leave for a new network state.

  11. /What about loyalty if everyone is switching all the time?/.
     There are many mechanism to rebuild loyalty on the basis of
      conscious, affirmative consent. For example, at the time of
      signing the social smart contract, incentives may be offered for
      longer-term contracts and coinholding periods.  Attractive
      cultures may also serve as network effects that keep people from
      leaving a network state at the drop of a hat.  There is always a
      balance; the point is to amplify the possibility of choice, not
      to build a mercenary society. But there will be several
      possible solutions here, so different network states
      will do this differently.

  12. /How does the network state resolve significant disputes?/ First
      off, part of the goal is to build a civilization that values
      digital civility. So many disputes are really about disrespect
      rather than substantive differences. But with respect to
      substantive issues, one way of thinking about the network state
      is as a union of sovereign collectives. Each sufficiently large
      network node has a CEO that folds into the CEO of the overall
      network state, which owns a stake in that node. If that CEO so
      chooses, they can spin out their network node into their own
      network state, or detach and join another network state. The
      signage of network state 1 goes down, and network state 2 goes
      up. This is a new mechanism for dynamic geography.

  13. /How does a network state come to consensus?/. The network state
      is based on the ledger of record, which is a feed of
      cryptographically signed events. The metadata on these events
      can be validated (such as proof-of-who, proof-of-when, and
      proof-of-what via hash) and in this sense what is true is now
      based on math even more than "science". This ledger of record
      turns every information source into an oracle or an
      advocate. The former is a dispassionate stream of data, the
      latter is interpretation on top of it.  Just as every citizen
      posts on social media today, every citizen will be considered a
      citizen journalist tomorrow.  Some will raw report information
      via oracles that gets recorded in that network state's ledger of
      record, while most others will provide commentary. Everything
      will be signed with their digital signature, and there will be a
      web of trust and many interlocking levels of automated rating
      and peer review. A key concept is prioritizing truly independent
      replication over "peer review" or mere retweeting. The goal is a
      community aligned around cryptographic consensus.

That wraps up our high level overview of the network state, and the
initial FAQ. As a next step, you can make proposed edits to this PDF,
fix typos, and add comments at [[https://github.com/1729/content/issues][github.com/1729/content/issues]]. We'd
appreciate it if you did this!
 
* Footnotes 
[fn:1] Another difference is that the people of the network state
wouldn't have a single employer like Google. There would be as many
different sources of income as there were network state citizens.

[fn:2] Think of interoperability between network state citizenship
status as being a complex, fruitful ground for innovation -f much like
interoperability between blockchains, and based on many of the same
concepts given that citizenship is partially predicated on coin
possession.

[fn:4] Yes, you may not use Facebook.com today. But you probably used
it in the past, or use it solely as a login mechanism, or use
Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, or one of Meta's other properties. The
point should be clear; feel free to substitute Google here as well
should you choose.

[fn:5] This observation inverts the concept of the "temporarily
embarassed millionaire"; it is, in fact, much easier to become a
millionaire, or even a billionaire, than it is to become a
president. The opposite phenomenon of someone who believes that change
is best sought through the legacy political system is best
characterized as a temporarily embarassed politician.

[fn:6] This is different from, but complementary to, the fluidity of
transitioning from citzen to founder, and back.

[fn:7] Or to exit if they truly cannot come to agreement. While this
is much more salient in the network state environment, it's still a
last resort.

[fn:8] To our best knowledge, of course. But as the saying goes, two
men can keep a secret if one man is dead. Given the idiosyncracy of
the project and the consistency of the voice, I find it unlikely that
Satoshi was venture-backed or a team.

[fn:9] Some national borders are more like natural borders, in the
sense that they track geographical, religious, or linguistic
differences. For example, the nation state of the UK and that of
France are divided by the English Channel, a geographical
delimiter. The UK also includes Northern Ireland, which roughly maps
to the religious boundary of Protestant vs Catholic. The internal
divisions of the UK into England, Wales, and Scotland map to
historical linguistic boundaries. Finally, the UK itself is
responsible for much more artificial boundaries that map to neither
geography, nor religion, nor language, such as the vertical and
horizontal colonial lines that divide up Africa. This is a classic
example of "Seeing Like a State", because those lines are clean on a
map but cut right through historical ethnic and linguistic groups,
resulting in weak states that don't reflect one historical people at
the time of state formation. Of course, over time, these social
constructs can start influencing language and genetics; for example,
it's usually easier to marry someone within your nation state than
outside it. Still, this is a good example of an artificial national boundary.

[fn:10] See the Sovereign Individual, David Sacks' tweet, and Lakoff's
concept of subscription fees as the price one pays for being a
citizen - though the latter may balk at taking the concept seriously
rather than merely rhetorically!
