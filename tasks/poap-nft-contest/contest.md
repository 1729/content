# Earn BTC By Creating NFT Art For 1729

We're looking for artwork to use in our official 1729 NFT credentials, and we're offering BTC for it. We'll pay one creator $1000 USD in BTC per piece of unique, original art that we can use in our NFTs.

## The task

In order to identify a combination of a creator + art style that will best fit the 1729 credentials, we're asking artists in the community to submit four sample PNGs for four different types of badges:

1. Attending a lecture (i.e., the POAPs we're already giving out)
2. Proof of workout
3. Hosting a 1729 meetup
4. Attending a 1729 meetup.

All four of these images should be recognizable as part of a collection -- with a similar style and theme. The idea is that when someone sees future images in the series, they should recognize them as 1729 credentials. 

You can submit your work at the following link in either gallery or file form:

We'll use the winner's work for our next round of POAPs issued for those four contributions, and we'll pay $1000 USD per piece for a total of $4000 USD.

## Background

1729 is preparing to begin issuing a growing variety of on-chain credentials in NFT form for different kinds of contributions to the network state. By "contributions," we don't just mean things you build for others to use -- we're also talking about building up yourself. When a 1729 member levels up by learning, burning, and earning, the network state also levels up. And whenever someone helps build the network state, we want to acknowledge that with cryptographic proof.

The initial form our NFTs will take is the POAP, which we already give out for attending the VR lectures and submitting feedback. Future POAPs will be given out for other contributions of various kinds.

As the 1729 NFT collection grows, we may shift to some other form of token or even another chain. But we want there to be a recognizable unity to the first wave of original 1729 credentials, so that anyone who sees them in the future will recognize the bearer as having helped build the early foundation for the first network state.
